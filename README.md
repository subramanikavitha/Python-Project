This is a Python-based computer knowledge-based quiz game that uses the Open Trivia API to generate questions, and options for the player to answer. The game uses a simple graphical user interface (GUI) created with the Tkinter library.

Installation To run the game, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

You will also need to install the requests library, which you can do by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

pip install requests
Usage

To play the game, simply run the main.py file in your Python environment:
